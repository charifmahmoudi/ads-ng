# ads-ng
With a growth of more than 4 % per years which reached 531 billion dollars all over the world, the advertising market is strongly impacted by the new technologies. The mobility and the dynamic billposters are at the heart of this revolution of the advertising media. The mobile aspect seduces because of its closeness of the consumer. Furthermore, the technical functions such as the geo-localization allow to target better the user and then, increase the efficiency of advertising campaigns. The dynamic display screens have a significant impact on the deployment of ads campaigns and the blow of maintenance of the billposters.

The European Union counts more than 240 Smart Cites. The intelligent transport are one of the main pillars of this trend towards an intelligent governance of the resources. However, an intelligent and ecological transport require a new vision of on-board equipment especially for billposters which are not any more adapted to the new generation of transport.

We propose an innovative solution which rethinks the way of functioning of the services offered by the means of transportation. In particular the management of the advertising and interactions between the user and the means of transportation by gathering the notion of mobility and the dynamic display of advertising. We propose a new technology to allow the dynamic billposters outside of vehicles. Our solution allows to associate an advertising partner has a locality to adapt the display of the dynamic screens fixed to all the vehicles which passes in transit by this locality has a given partner. This approach allows to encourage the local advertising by opening the market to the convenience store.

We propose a new business model in the form of a market where the announcers can outbid localities to have the preference on this locality. So, the advertising partner shown on the locality is dynamically calculated according to a rule of bids. The invoicing is calculated with the number of real display in a given zone. Furthermore, private individuals or companies having a car fleet can create new advertising spaces on their vehicles and offer their services on this new advertising market. 

Besides the billposters advertising, the solution embarked on vehicles contains an accessible mechanism of geolocation as well as the services to the transport users such as a free WiFi connection, a notification of the approach of vehicles for transport or delivery, the request of stop for the public transportation, and either the ride sharing for private individuals' participating cars.

The intelligent cities, besides the already quoted services, can requisition all the participating vehicles in case of threat to pass messages. In case of attack for example, the advertising media will be used to redirect the traffic a real time to optimize the time of answer of the strength of the order and the help.
